This leaderhead is made out of tow converted models from Granado Espada (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granado_Espada). Therefore, while slightly modifications of the models and artwork were made by me, I take no credit for both and all rights are with IMC Games Co.

This leaderhead uses Hammurabi animations. It's completely modular. All files in the zip-file are already put into the necessary folders, unzipping it directly in the Mods folder of BtS should result into a working mod. It has a polycount of about 7100 triangles. There are a noshader and a shader version included.
